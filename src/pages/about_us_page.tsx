            Munmay Swainâ€™s journey into photography began in his school years,
            with a vision to become a professional photographer, though he was
            uncertain about the specific field he would pursue. In 2015, he took
            his first step by purchasing a crop-sensor DSLR camera, which soon
            became an essential tool for honing his craft. With no formal
            training, he started by taking photos of friends, who often invited
            him to click their pictures simply because he owned a DSLR. Despite
            his lack of experience, his friends praised his work, admiring the
            creativity he brought to each shot. This positive feedback motivated
            Munmay to take photography more seriously, realizing he had a
            natural talent for capturing people and moments.
